# Wilson2

![alt tag](https://github.com/mjrice/Wilson2/blob/master/doc/wilson-source-weblogo.png)

This is the design repository for the Wilson II - a reprap 3D printer based on Wilson TS, inspired by the Prusa i3 and the Lulzbot TAZ.

The respository has these sub directories:

    stl/ contains the STL files needed to build the printer
    doc/ contains documentation, images, bom, etc.
    scad/ contains the design files of those parts for which OpenSCAD was used.
    sketchup/ contains the design files of those parts for which SketchUp was used.

There is also a community forum for this project, located at http://community.reprapwilson3d.com
